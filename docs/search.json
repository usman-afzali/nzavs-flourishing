    "text": "Welcome To the Flourishing Lab!\n\nExecutive Summary of the Project\nThe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, < .01% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by N = 1500 participants, thus enabling to explore the science of Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level. This project is important because the lifelong dynamics of religious minority flourishing are poorly understood. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this study will address an urgent scientific need. Our work with the Muslim community reveals a strong community interest in Muslim flourishing science, and this project will foster this interest by involving the community in longitudinal science. The target audience of this project are the Muslim community, academics, science readers, rights advocates, and policy makers. The outputs are a rich longitudinal dataset of 3660 observations, 6 public talks, a seminar for government officials, and six publications.\n\n\nThe Need for this Project\nA panel study follows the same individuals over time and is ideal for addressing questions about how life experiences combine with beliefs and circumstances that affect human flourishing. However, because the necessary longitudinal datasets are lacking, little is known about the dynamics of Muslim faith and flourishing. It is important to address this gap in understanding because: (a) religion has long been theorized to play an enabling role in human flourishing and (b) Islam is a growing religion. As such, the systemic study of Muslim flourishing is among science’s greatest uncharted frontiers. In addition, Muslims have been the targets of stereotyping and prejudice in New Zealand: this project will clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths. Finally, much of our work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived, however, we have identified strong signals of Muslim interest in flourishing science: recently, we have talked with 29 Muslims from diverse backgrounds across New Zealand. They had a 100% agreement on conducting research on Muslims self-perception, as well as the scientific study of Muslim flourishing. Therefore, we believe that the proposed project will amplify our community partnerships.\nThis project will have the most importance to Muslims as explained above. Additionally, it will also be important to the public, and to understanding about Muslims living in the Western countries that share a similar way of life with New Zealand.\nThis project will give us a scientific understanding of Muslim flourishing, thereby, a timely and under-researched connection of religion and flourishing will be explored. The data from this project could also be used by NZAVS researchers who publish on other aspects of life such as health, politics, life satisfaction, etc. This is substantial because due to minute participation of Muslims in the ongoing NZAVS research, we do not have meaningful understanding about these aspects of Muslims in New Zealand. After completion of the project, we would have established a Muslim flourishing research lab in New Zealand that would attract further research and scholarship.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis website is intended to provide introduction to the NZAVS Flourishing project. Furthermore, findings, progress reports, publications, and data analysis code will be made available in a timely manner."

    "text": "We propose a novel longitudinal study of Muslims in New Zealand. The proposed study will build on the existing capacity of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) infrastructure and will add N = 1500 Muslim participants to its longitudinal sample.\nThe purpose of our project is to develop a first-class longitudinal science of Muslim religious diversity in New Zealand that is capable of changing conversations about religion. The challenge to such a conversation-changing science can be expressed simply: data about Muslim flourishing are lacking. This application describes our step-by-step plan for longitudinal data collection from across New Zealand’s diverse Muslim community. Before describing our plan for data collection, we must first describe our partnership with the NZAVS. This background will help to clarify the motivation, interest, and prospects for success of our proposed longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand.\nThe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a national longitudinal probability study that has been collecting data on New Zealanders’ health, personality, relationships, employment, behaviors, values, beliefs, and community-making annually since 2009.\nBecause the same individuals are measured each year, NZAVS data enable researchers to evaluate causal theories about what makes life good for people and how the good life varies across demographically diverse populations. The NZAVS is notable for having a large sample (currently about 1% of New Zealand’s adult population, which was recruited randomly). The NZAVS also has a very good annual retention rate of about 80%, which is made possible by the access that qualified researchers in New Zealand have to the government’s electoral roll. Without a capacity for following people as they move and change contact details, retention would be very difficult. The NZAVS questionnaire is made available in both print and online formats (“New Zealand Attitudes And Values Study” 2023), which further increases the reach of the study into communities that are not familiar with internet technologies. In 2018, 42 new items were added to the NZAVS questionnaire to investigate the causal interplay of humility, gratitude, forgiveness, generosity, and multi-dimensional human flourishing. These items enable researchers to systematically investigate how these virtues are affected by community-making, how community-making affects these virtues, whether the interplay of community-making and virtue affects dimensions of human flourishing, and if so, which are specifically affected. As mentioned, the present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing to the Muslim community in New Zealand, where response rates are ten-fold times lower than they are for other major religious groups. The under-representation of Muslims, then, is the critical challenge to the longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand. Our study will address this mission-critical challenge by collecting new data from across a nationally diverse Muslim community and recruiting participants into the NZAVS.\nThe present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing study to the Muslim community in New Zealand.\nThe fact, that our study is leveraging NZAVS capacity, makes it a low-cost/low-risk/high-yield investment in the science of human flourishing. The NZAVS has many dozens of collaborators from within New Zealand and across the world, who have collectively published over 150 scientific articles. The NZAVS has developed effective relationships with churches, mosques, community leaders, minority communities, business leaders, and the government. Further information regarding NZAVS can be found online (“The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study - the University of Auckland,” n.d.)."

    "text": "What are the barriers to the longitudinal science of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand?\nOur discussions with the Muslim community suggest three major obstacles to Muslim involvement in longitudinal survey research: 1) a lack of awareness about benefits of longitudinal flourishing science for the Muslim community; 2) a general mistrust of institutions; 3) language barriers.\nIn short, our project will address these three problems by engaging in community outreach, education, and questionnaire translation. These activities will put the longitudinal study of spirituality for Muslims on an equal footing with other religious and secular communities in New Zealand. Additionally, the project researchers have fostered support from Muslim community leaders based on trusting relationships. Such support and relationships are critical for any successful science of Muslim flourishing. Our plan is not merely to collect data, but also to make good on our trusting relationships by sharing our science with the Muslim community, and by engaging the Muslim community as partners in our science.\nIn detail:\nDuring the past five months we have initiated a consultation plan with members of New Zealand Muslim community. Specifically, we have conducted semi-structured interviews/discussions with 29 Muslims, including community leaders, religious scholars, youth activists, and everyday Muslims from across New Zealand. This Advisory Group includes different age groups, and males and females from Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland, New Zealand’s three largest cities. There have been four objectives: 1) To assess the feasibility of the project for Muslims, 2) To assess interest of Muslims in the project, 3) To get feedback on the survey items (Please see the attached NZAVS technical details document in TRT-2022-30579-Response-to-Bounce-Memo), and 4) To inquire if translation may be needed. Through all these efforts, we are happy to report that the community response has been positive in three ways: First, all 29 respondents believed that the study was feasible for Muslims and that Muslims will be interested to participate. In addition, the highest participation should be anticipated from youth, second generation migrants, educated, and women. Second, not only did this Advisory Group believe that the study and our planned measures were important, they have also promised to support us in every possible way. Third, there has been a consensus that a majority of participants will be able to use the English version. Nevertheless, to reach a broader bandwidth of Muslim diversity, we will need to pilot and test translated versions of the NZAVS flourishing scales and survey."

    "text": "The Muslim community in New Zealand faces adversity but is resilient\nBefore describing this plan, it may be helpful to describe some additional context about the Muslim community in New Zealand and our previous research on Muslims in New Zealand. In our previous research, investigating attitudes towards Muslims and minorities, we found that Muslims are among the least accepted groups in New Zealand (3, 4). Recently, the community suffered White supremacist terrorist attacks on two mosques which killed 51 people. Despite these challenges, our qualitative research indicates that many Muslims in New Zealand are flourishing. To systematically identify the factors that enable Muslim flourishing, however, requires data. The first motivation for this study is to collect such data so that the many untold stories of Muslim flourishing may be recorded and understood. By contrast, without such data, the NZAVS will be limited to investigating how Muslims in New Zealand are perceived (3, 4, 5, 6, 7). To this end, we have developed a plan that will recruit N = 1500 Muslims into the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study."

    "section": "The project goals",
    "text": "The project goals\nWe want to recruit N = 1500 Muslims to participate in NZAVS for three years, train a next generation longitudinal researchers, publish excellent scientific articles, and enhance the study’s community impact through collaborative scholarly network and public service community group.\nThe first goal of this project is to recruit New Zealand Muslims for participating in NZAVS for three years, resulting in 3 waves of panel data. In addition to the current NZAVS data, achieving this goal will result in a novel, powerful dataset for investigating the personal and social aspects of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand. The bottom line in any science is high-quality data measured purposefully and accurately for specific questions. The Templeton Religion Trust (TRT)’s primary mission is to promote an outstanding science of religion and its consequences. Our first project objective, to conserve and extend longitudinal data collection to the Muslim community, aligns directly with this basic TRT purpose.\nThe second goal of this project is to continue publishing high-quality scientific research, which has yielded more than 150 TRT/TWCF (Templeton World Charity Foundation) funded publications since 2013. We estimate that the project will produce 6 scientific publications. Moreover, with over a decade’s worth of longitudinal data collected, the NZAVS team is poised to make important contributions to science. The team’s expected scientific productivity over the course of our project will promote TRT’s core mission of fostering excellence for religion and spirituality science.\nThe third goal is to support an early career post-doctoral researcher. Usman Afzali will be recruited as a post-doctoral researcher who will lead this project along with Prof Joseph Bulbulia and would train and manage research assistants to collect data. Usman will also be involved in grant-writing. Doing science with an early career researcher will help him to secure tenure-track appointment, and tenure – all fundamental priorities for the advancement of a longitudinal science of religion and spirituality over the long haul.\nThe fourth goal is to bring the Muslim community closer to NZAVS and science. As a result of community talks and the use of NZAVS data in government policy, one of the religious groups in New Zealand (i.e., Muslims) will come to see how science and religion jointly play a critical role in understanding human flourishing.\nAlthough extensive data are lacking in relation to virtues and attitudes in Muslim community, we expect that Muslims will exhibit similar levels of flourishing as members of highly identified non-Muslim denominations, and perhaps somewhat greater levels of flourishing than weakly identified or secular minority migrants. NZAVS data show that perceived religious discrimination is declining only among people with lower levels of religious identification (see Appendix A). Among those with higher levels of religious identification, perceived religious discrimination remains high. We expect Muslims to exhibit perceived religious discrimination at levels comparable to highly religious non-Muslims. Indeed, this is what the NZAVS observes in its current, small Muslim sample (Appendix B). The NZAVS also finds that Muslims perceive religion to be a social good, at levels similar to smaller Christian denominations (Appendix C). We expect this study to clarify the grounds of these judgments."

    "text": "Methodology\nParticipants: N = 1,500 members of the Muslims communities in New Zealand (50% female), belonging to various ethnic groups (Middle Eastern, African, South-Asian, etc.), from three large cities (Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington), aged 18 and above.\nMeasures: The NZAVS questionnaire will be translated to seven languages proposed by the Muslim community. These are: Arabic, Persian, Pashto, Somali, Urdu, Bangla, and Turkish. Based on the level of English comprehension, the participants will have the choice to use either the English version or the translated version. The NZAVS questionnaire items and further details can be accessed via this url: https://go-bayes.github.io/reports/posts/nzavs/#link-to-data-dictionary-and-questions\nTranslation: Our consultation with the Advisory Group shows that the translation may only be needed for a small number of Muslims living in New Zealand, and that a majority will be able to use the English version. This gives us a methodological safety-net since we can be more confident that the meaning of concepts is not distorted because of translation. As far as the translation itself is concerned, we have consulted with a group (Sulaiman-Hill and colleagues) who have been conducting research within the Muslim community. Therefore, instead of using the common translation back-translation procedure, we will use a more effective way of translating, back-translating, and comparing notes to ensure conceptual equivalence (8). This method is inspired by the recent developments and recommendations based on the needs in countries that home an increasing number of refugees (9, 10). Following this, the translation will be checked by experts as recommend by Fenn and colleagues (11) and piloted within the Advisory Group to ensure reliability and conceptual equivalence.\nProcedure (data collection): We will achieve our goal of data collection by reaching out to the many community organizations. Specifically, the lead PI (Usman Afzali) has already consulted with and gained support for this initiative through the following community organizations:\n\nThe Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand\nMuslim Association of Canterbury\nLinwood Islamic Trust\nCanterbury Muslim Community Trust\nIslamic Women’s Council New Zealand (IWCNZ)\nPANZ: Pakistan Association of New Zealand\nAANZ: Afghan Association of New Zealand\nUCMUSA: University of Canterbury Muslim Students Association\nNIYA: National Islamic Youth Association\nPurapura Whetu Trust Muslim Wellbeing Team\nFAIR (Foundation Against Islamophobia and Racism)\nNew Zealand Muslim Association\nWellington Islamic Centre – IMAN\n\nWe will further consult with the community leadership and translate the questionnaires. Following this, we will recruit 10 paid research assistants (RAs) from the Muslim community to assist with data collection, and we will pilot the questionnaires and translations. With the help from the mentioned organizations, we will then deliver three inaugural talks in the three largest cities of New Zealand (Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington), followed by data collection from N = 1,500 participants. The temporal gap between Wave 1 and Wave 2 will be used to write a method article and two science papers. We will collect Wave 2 in the second year followed by three community talks in three large cities (Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington) based on our findings. After Wave 3, we will work on mechanisms to ensure continuous participation from the Muslim community within the NZAVS framework. During the third year, we will also submit three papers for publication and deliver a government seminar to inform the authorities and policy makers within the Ministry for Ethnic Communities, Ministry of Social Development and Department of Prime Minister and the Cabinet of our findings.\nThe NZAVS laboratory, led by Chris Sibley, has an established record of excellence in longitudinal data collection, built over 13 years of experience. Such a record demonstrates the low risk of this proposal."

    "text": "The evidence for project success\nThe NZAVS is on track to complete 13 years of data collection, has published over 150 scientific articles, and has extended the research network to over 50 domestic and international collaborators. We have effectively translated longitudinal research on spirituality and human flourishing to the New Zealand government, national church and business leaders, and continue to regularly convey our findings to communities through public talks and outreach. For evidence of our impact see: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5zj3o8nggkd0qh6/Sup3-Meetings-Talks-TRT2021.html?dl=0 We are committed to promoting excellence for the longitudinal study of religion and spirituality by helping emerging researchers and advising teams in other countries. Our study has hardly scratched the surface of possibility for panel studies. We are keen to help other research groups develop panel studies of religion. To advance the science of religion, a library full of owl-sketches await to be drafted.\nA good argument for our present project is that we have already demonstrated we can do the highly demanding work of building and retaining a large and diverse longitudinal sample, and that we have the know-how to promote the success of future generation of researchers."

    "text": "Timeline\nMonths 1-3\n\nConsult with Muslim community leadership.\nTranslate surveys in ethnic languages as determined by community needs. Months 4-6\nHire and train RAs for booster support in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch (New Zealand’s largest cities).\nExtensively pilot the survey and translations.\nPre-register research on open-science platforms\n\nMonths 6-12\n\nDeliver inaugural talks in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch within public venues. Usman will speak to cover the history of NZAVS, the importance of flourishing, and what it would take for people to participate. Other speakers TBC.\nAdminister the Muslim booster (N = 1500).\nIntegrate responses within the broader NZAVS sample.\n\nMonths 13-17\n\nDraft methods article on translation, recruitment, and longitudinal design.\nDraft descriptive articles on Muslim diversity (cross-sectional papers).\n\nMonths 18-24\n\nSubmit articles.\nAdminister second Muslim booster with RA support focused on participant retention.\n\nMonths 24-36\n\nDeliver community talks based on findings so far, in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch, within public venues. Usman will speak to cover findings and share insights from descriptive studies. Other speakers TBC.\nAdminister 3rd wave of booster.\nWork with Muslim community to sustain support through future (unfunded) waves.\nRAs to work with individuals and families on retention needs beyond project, to be supported within ongoing NZAVS infrastructure.\nPrepare draft of two-wave longitudinal Muslim research articles (pre/post exposure), submitted by project close.\nDeliver a government seminar (Ministry for Ethnic Communities, Ministry of Social Development, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet)\n\n\nRisks\n\nWe cannot ensure participation.\nNew Zealand’s Muslim community is culturally and linguistically diverse; although we have substantially consulted with them, all their needs cannot be fully anticipated in advance.\nEffectiveness of retention strategies beyond the life of project is presently unclear.\n\n\n\nHow are risks mitigated?\n\ninitial community support is very positive.\nmethods paper will document both failed and successful recruitment strategies.\nproject has scope to translate the survey into at least 7 languages.\n\nOverall, we perceive a much greater risk from the certain loss of understanding that will arise from inaction, as well as the lost opportunities to cultivate an interest in science among New Zealand’s Muslim communities. Cost effectiveness of the Muslim booster Assuming 1/2 project resources are required for recruitment/retention and 3660 responses over 3 waves, cost is $62 per response. This is inclusive of translation, data entry, recruitment, and retention. Efficiency increases over time: if Muslims participate in NZAVS after project closure, that will not cost us any further."

    "text": "Privacy and retention\nThe community will be informed during inaugural talks regarding our seriousness and care in relation to their privacy and confidentiality being our highest priority. We are following the NZAVS privacy model, in which only Chris G Sibley, the lead researcher of the NZAVS, and those who work as part of the physical NZAVS laboratory in Auckland have access to personal information. After being scanned and encrypted, all surveys are immediately de-identified: no one entering NZAVS data can access personal information. NZAVS protocols have long adopted rigorous standards for data security. This information will be conveyed to all participants. In addition, we will be regulated by the University of Canterbury Human Research Ethic Committee (Institutional Review Board) – that will review our processes and we will adhere to them incredibly strictly.\nPartnering with large community organizations, developing a diverse cross-national advisory board, and working with RAs from within the community, in our opinion, will ensure retention after the project finishes."
