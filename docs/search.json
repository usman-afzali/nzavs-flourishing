    "text": "Welcome To the Flourishing Lab!\n\nExecutive Summary of the Project\nThe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, < .01% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by N = 1500 participants, thus enabling to explore the science of Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level. This project is important because the lifelong dynamics of religious minority flourishing are poorly understood. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this study will address an urgent scientific need. Our work with the Muslim community reveals a strong community interest in Muslim flourishing science, and this project will foster this interest by involving the community in longitudinal science. The target audience of this project are the Muslim community, academics, science readers, rights advocates, and policy makers. The outputs are a rich longitudinal dataset of 3660 observations, 6 public talks, a seminar for government officials, and six publications.\n\n\nThe Need for this Project\nA panel study follows the same individuals over time and is ideal for addressing questions about how life experiences combine with beliefs and circumstances that affect human flourishing. However, because the necessary longitudinal datasets are lacking, little is known about the dynamics of Muslim faith and flourishing. It is important to address this gap in understanding because: (a) religion has long been theorized to play an enabling role in human flourishing and (b) Islam is a growing religion. As such, the systemic study of Muslim flourishing is among science’s greatest uncharted frontiers. In addition, Muslims have been the targets of stereotyping and prejudice in New Zealand: this project will clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths. Finally, much of our work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived, however, we have identified strong signals of Muslim interest in flourishing science: recently, we have talked with 29 Muslims from diverse backgrounds across New Zealand. They had a 100% agreement on conducting research on Muslims self-perception, as well as the scientific study of Muslim flourishing. Therefore, we believe that the proposed project will amplify our community partnerships.\nThis project will have the most importance to Muslims as explained above. Additionally, it will also be important to the public, and to understanding about Muslims living in the Western countries that share a similar way of life with New Zealand.\nThis project will give us a scientific understanding of Muslim flourishing, thereby, a timely and under-researched connection of religion and flourishing will be explored. The data from this project could also be used by NZAVS researchers who publish on other aspects of life such as health, politics, life satisfaction, etc. This is substantial because due to minute participation of Muslims in the ongoing NZAVS research, we do not have meaningful understanding about these aspects of Muslims in New Zealand. After completion of the project, we would have established a Muslim flourishing research lab in New Zealand that would attract further research and scholarship.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis website is intended to provide introduction to the NZAVS Flourishing project. Furthermore, findings, progress reports, publications, and data analysis code will be made available in a timely manner."

    "text": "Hello/Salaam/Kia ora. I am Usman Afzali - a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Canterbury. I completed my PhD in psychology and am currently the principal investigator of the three-year Muslim Flourishing Project (started 2023), built on the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) framework. Beside research, I teach two courses, Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience and Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics, in the School of Psychology at University of Canterbury.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsman Afzali, PhD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am originally from Afghanistan and have been living in Christchurch since 2011. I have been a regular attendee of Al-Noor mosque and were close to many victims of Christchurch Terrorist Attacks. Since 2019, I have published several articles with NZAVS focusing on anti-Muslim attitudes in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\nI noted that NZAVS did not have many Muslim participants - which limits the inferences we can make about how Muslims perceive themselves in New Zealand, what makes them resilient, and what makes them flourish despite atrocities. This is why the current project was conceived. Our aim is to collect longitudinal data from Muslims of New Zealand and publish our findings in peer-reviewed Open Science scientific journals1. These outputs will provide an objective account of Muslims’ social attitudes and values in New Zealand, and will allow Muslims to use these findings to advocate for their rights.\n\n\n\n\nWe are recuriting Muslim research assistants from the community - which will not only help us train a new cohort of Muslim researchers, but also help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science."

    "text": "We propose a novel longitudinal study of Muslims in New Zealand. The proposed study will build on the existing capacity of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) infrastructure and will add N = 1500 Muslim participants to its longitudinal sample.\nThe purpose of our project is to develop a first-class longitudinal science of Muslim religious diversity in New Zealand that is capable of changing conversations about religion. The challenge to such a conversation-changing science can be expressed simply: data about Muslim flourishing are lacking. This application describes our step-by-step plan for longitudinal data collection from across New Zealand’s diverse Muslim community. Before describing our plan for data collection, we must first describe our partnership with the NZAVS. This background will help to clarify the motivation, interest, and prospects for success of our proposed longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand.\nThe New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a national longitudinal probability study that has been collecting data on New Zealanders’ health, personality, relationships, employment, behaviors, values, beliefs, and community-making annually since 2009.\nBecause the same individuals are measured each year, NZAVS data enable researchers to evaluate causal theories about what makes life good for people and how the good life varies across demographically diverse populations. The NZAVS is notable for having a large sample (currently about 1% of New Zealand’s adult population, which was recruited randomly). The NZAVS also has a very good annual retention rate of about 80%, which is made possible by the access that qualified researchers in New Zealand have to the government’s electoral roll. Without a capacity for following people as they move and change contact details, retention would be very difficult. The NZAVS questionnaire is made available in both print and online formats (1), which further increases the reach of the study into communities that are not familiar with internet technologies. In 2018, 42 new items were added to the NZAVS questionnaire to investigate the causal interplay of humility, gratitude, forgiveness, generosity, and multi-dimensional human flourishing. These items enable researchers to systematically investigate how these virtues are affected by community-making, how community-making affects these virtues, whether the interplay of community-making and virtue affects dimensions of human flourishing, and if so, which are specifically affected. As mentioned, the present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing to the Muslim community in New Zealand, where response rates are ten-fold times lower than they are for other major religious groups. The under-representation of Muslims, then, is the critical challenge to the longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand. Our study will address this mission-critical challenge by collecting new data from across a nationally diverse Muslim community and recruiting participants into the NZAVS.\nThe present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing study to the Muslim community in New Zealand.\nThe fact, that our study is leveraging NZAVS capacity, makes it a low-cost/low-risk/high-yield investment in the science of human flourishing. The NZAVS has many dozens of collaborators from within New Zealand and across the world, who have collectively published over 150 scientific articles. The NZAVS has developed effective relationships with churches, mosques, community leaders, minority communities, business leaders, and the government. Further information regarding NZAVS can be found online (2)."
