Hello/Salaam/Kia ora. I am Usman Afzali - a postdoctoral research fellow at University of Canterbury. I completed my PhD in psychology and am currently the principal investigator of the three-year Muslim Flourishing Project (started 2023), built on the [New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html) (NZAVS) framework.
Beside research, I teach two courses, [Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC480&occurrence=23S1(C)&year=2023) and [Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/courseinfo/GetCourseDetails.aspx?course=PSYC344&occurrence=22S2(C)&year=2022), in the School of Psychology at University of Canterbury.

I am originally from Afghanistan and have been living in Christchurch since 2011. I have been a regular attendee of Al-Noor mosque and were close to many victims of Christchurch Terrorist Attacks. Since 2019, I have published several articles with NZAVS focusing on anti-Muslim attitudes in New Zealand. 

#### Why I do this research?

I noted that NZAVS did not have many Muslim participants - which limits the inferences we can make about how Muslims perceive themselves in New Zealand, what makes them resilient, and what makes them flourish despite atrocities. This is why the current project was conceived. Our aim is to collect longitudinal data from Muslims of New Zealand and publish our findings in peer-reviewed Open Science scientific journals^[Open Science articles can be accessed online by the any member of the public]. These outputs will provide an objective account of Muslims' social attitudes and values in New Zealand, and will allow Muslims to use these findings to advocate for their rights.

We are recuriting Muslim research assistants from the community - which will not only help us train a new cohort of Muslim researchers, but also help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science.
