Hello/Salaam/Kia ora. I am Usman Afzali - a postdoctoral research fellow
at University of Canterbury. I completed my PhD in psychology and am
currently the principal investigator of the three-year Muslim
Flourishing Project (started 2023). Beside research, I also teach in the School of Psychology at University of Canterbury.
I am originally from Afghanistan and have been living in Christchurch
since 2011. In the past few years, I have published several articles with [New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html) (NZAVS) focusing on Muslim perception and attitudes towards Muslims in New Zealand.
My [CV](https://www.usmanafzali.com/cv), [scientific publications](https://www.usmanafzali.com/publications), and further information can be found on my
[website](https://www.usmanafzali.com).

#### Why I do this research?

I noted that NZAVS did not have many Muslim participants - which limits
the inferences we can make about how Muslims perceive themselves in New
Zealand, what makes them resilient, what makes them flourish despite
atrocities, and what factors contribute to meaning-making. This is why the current project was conceived. Our aim is to
collect longitudinal data from Muslims of New Zealand and publish our
findings in peer-reviewed Open Science scientific journals[^1]. These
outputs will provide an objective account of Muslims' social attitudes
and values in New Zealand, and will allow Muslims to use these findings
to advocate for their rights. In addition, such findings could be used to inform and influence government policy in relation to Muslim rights, and minority rights in general. Finally, our findings could also be used in other Muslim minority countries to spread awareness.

We are recruiting Muslim research assistants from the community - which
will not only help us train a new cohort of Muslim researchers who might lead further Muslim-focused research, but also
help bring Muslims of New Zealand closer to science. This is what excites me, and this is why this project is so close to my heart.
