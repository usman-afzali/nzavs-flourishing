## The Project Description

We propose a novel longitudinal study of Muslims in New Zealand. The proposed study
will build on the existing capacity of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study
(NZAVS) infrastructure and will add N = 1500 Muslim participants to its longitudinal sample.

The purpose of our project is to develop a first-class longitudinal science of Muslim
religious diversity in New Zealand that is capable of changing conversations about
religion. The challenge to such a conversation-changing science can be expressed
simply: data about Muslim flourishing are lacking. This application describes our step-by-step plan for longitudinal data collection from across New Zealand’s diverse Muslim
community. Before describing our plan for data collection, we must first describe our
partnership with the NZAVS. This background will help to clarify the motivation, interest,
and prospects for success of our proposed longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in
New Zealand.

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a national longitudinal
probability study that has been collecting data on New Zealanders’ health, personality,
relationships, employment, behaviors, values, beliefs, and community-making annually
since 2009.

Because the same individuals are measured each year, NZAVS data enable
researchers to evaluate causal theories about what makes life good for people and
how the good life varies across demographically diverse populations. The NZAVS is notable for having a large sample (currently about 1% of New Zealand’s adult population, which was recruited randomly). The NZAVS also has a very good annual retention rate of about 80%, which is made possible by the access that qualified researchers in New Zealand have to the government's electoral roll. Without a capacity for following people as they move and change contact details, retention would be very difficult. The NZAVS questionnaire is made available in both print and online formats (1), which further increases the reach of the study into communities that are not familiar with internet technologies. In 2018, 42 new items were added to the NZAVS questionnaire to investigate the causal interplay of humility, gratitude, forgiveness, generosity, and multi-dimensional human flourishing. These items enable researchers to systematically investigate how these virtues are affected by community-making, how community-making affects these virtues, whether the interplay of community-making and virtue affects dimensions of human flourishing, and if so, which are specifically affected. As mentioned, the present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal study of human flourishing to the Muslim community in New Zealand, where response rates are ten-fold times lower than they are for other major religious groups. The under-representation of Muslims, then, is the critical challenge to the longitudinal study of Muslim flourishing in New Zealand. Our study will address this mission-critical challenge by collecting new data from across a nationally diverse Muslim community and recruiting participants into the NZAVS.

The present project offers an exciting opportunity to extend the NZAVS longitudinal
study of human flourishing study to the Muslim community in New Zealand.

The fact, that our study is leveraging NZAVS capacity, makes it a low-cost/low-risk/high-yield investment in the science of human flourishing. The NZAVS has many dozens of
collaborators from within New Zealand and across the world, who have collectively
published over 150 scientific articles. The NZAVS has developed effective relationships
with churches, mosques, community leaders, minority communities, business leaders,
and the government. Further information regarding NZAVS can be found online (2).
